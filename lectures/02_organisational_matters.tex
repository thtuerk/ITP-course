\frametitle{Aims of this Course}

\begin{block}{Aims}
\begin{itemize}
\item introduction to interactive theorem proving (ITP)
\item being able to evaluate whether a problem can benefit from ITP
\item hands-on experience with HOL
\item learn how to build a formal model
\item learn how to express and prove important properties of such a model
\item learn about basic conformance testing
\item use a theorem prover on a small project
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Required Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item some experience with functional programming
\item knowing Standard ML syntax
\item basic knowledge about logic (\eg First Order Logic)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dates}

\begin{itemize}
\item Interactive Theorem Proving Course takes place in Period 4 of the academic year 2016/2017
\item always in room 4523 or 4532
\item each week\\\medskip\qquad
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Mondays & 10:15 - 11:45 & lecture \\
Wednesdays & 10:00 - 12:00 & practical session \\
Fridays & 13:00 - 15:00 & practical session
\end{tabular}
\item no lecture on Monday, 1st of May, instead on Wednesday, 3rd May
\item last lecture: 12th of June
\item last practical session: 21st of June
\item 9 lectures, 17 practical sessions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exercises}

\begin{itemize}
\item after each lecture an exercise sheet is handed out
\item work on these exercises alone, except if stated otherwise explicitly
\item exercise sheet contains due date
\begin{itemize}
\item usually 10 days time to work on it
\item hand in during practical sessions
\item lecture Monday $\longrightarrow$ hand in at latest in next week's Friday session
\end{itemize}
\item main purpose: understanding ITP and learn how to use HOL
\begin{itemize}
\item no detailed grading, just pass/fail 
\item retries possible till pass
\item if stuck, ask me or one another
\item practical sessions intend to provide this opportunity 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Practical Sessions}

\begin{itemize}
\item very informal
\item main purpose: work on exercises
\begin{itemize}
\item I have a look and provide feedback
\item you can ask questions
\item I might sometimes explain things not covered in the lectures
\item I might provide some concrete tips and tricks
\item you can also discuss with each other
\end{itemize}
\item attendance not required, but highly recommended
\begin{itemize}
\item exception: session on 21st April
\end{itemize}
\item only requirement: turn up long enough to hand in exercises
\item \alert{you need to bring your own computer}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Handing-in Exercises}

\begin{itemize}
\item exercises are intended to be handed-in during practical sessions
\item attend at least one practical session each week
\item leave reasonable time to discuss exercises
\begin{itemize}
\item don't try to hand your solution in Friday 14:55
\end{itemize}
\item retries possible, but reasonable attempt before deadline required
\item handing-in outside practical sessions
\begin{itemize}
\item only if you have a good reason
\item decided on a case-by-case basis
\end{itemize}
\item electronic hand-ins 
\begin{itemize}
\item only to get detailed feedback
\item does not replace personal hand-in
\item exceptions on a case-by-case basis if there is a good reason
\item I recommend using a KTH GitHub repo
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Passing the ITP Course}

\begin{itemize}
\item there is only a pass/fail mark
\item to pass you need to
\begin{itemize}
\item attend at least 7 of the 9 lectures
\item pass 8 of the 9 exercises 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Communication}
\begin{itemize}
\item we have the advantage of being a small group
\item therefore we are flexible
\item so please ask questions, even during lectures
\item there are many shy people, therefore
\begin{itemize}
\item anonymous checklist after each lecture
\item anonymous background questionnaire in first practical session
\end{itemize}
\item further information is posted on \emph{Interactive Theorem Proving Course} group on Group Web
\item contact me (Thomas Tuerk) directly, \eg via email \texttt{thomas@kth.se}
\end{itemize}
